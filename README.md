# Dataops_for_Finance
This repo contains sample code to build basic Dataops pipeline for finance domain

Here is an example of a DataOps pipeline in the finance domain. This is a simplified example and may not cover all aspects of a real-world finance data pipeline. However, it should give you a good starting point. 
Here's how you can structure your pipeline:

Data Source:
Identify the source of your financial data, such as an API, a database, or CSV files.
Set up a data ingestion process to fetch data from the source and store it in a designated location. You can use tools like Apache Airflow or cron jobs to automate this process.
Create a folder in your GitHub repository to store scripts related to data ingestion, such as data_ingestion/.

Data Transformation:
Perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation operations on the raw data.
Write scripts or notebooks to carry out these operations and store them in a folder like data_transformation/.

Data Validation and Quality:
Develop data validation checks to ensure the integrity and quality of the data.
Implement validation scripts or notebooks to perform checks like data type validation, missing value checks, or range checks. Store them in a folder like data_validation/.

Data Storage:
Decide on the appropriate storage solution for your finance data, such as a relational database, a data lake, or a cloud-based storage service.Create a folder like data_storage/ to include scripts related to data storage, such as database connection setup or file upload/download scripts.

Data Analysis and Reporting:
Utilize tools like Jupyter notebooks or business intelligence platforms to perform exploratory data analysis and generate reports.
Store your analysis scripts or notebooks in a folder like data_analysis/.

Data Pipeline Orchestration:
Choose a workflow management tool to orchestrate the entire pipeline. Some popular options include Apache Airflow, Luigi, or Prefect.
Create workflows or DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) that define the order and dependencies of your pipeline tasks.
Store your workflow definition files in a folder like pipeline_orchestration/.

Version Control and Collaboration:
Initialize a Git repository on GitHub to manage your pipeline codebase.
Commit and push your scripts, notebooks, and workflow definition files to the repository.
Leverage features like branching, pull requests, and code reviews to facilitate collaboration and ensure code quality.


Remember, this is a high-level overview, and you may need to adjust it according to the specific requirements and technologies used in your finance data pipeline.
